    "When the control space is discrete, the optimal policy is directly obtained by maximizing the Q value by an exhaustive search. This does not work for continuous space. In that case, a policy network must be trained in parallel, to greedily optimize the Q function. A famous algorithm for that, which is a near direct extension of Deep-Q, is the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). \n",
    "\n",
    "Like Deep-Q, it optimizes the Q function to contract the Belman residual. To efficiently do that, it also uses minibatches to avoid the local collapses due to sample dependancy. In addition, it uses a smoothing of the gradient direction, using a so-called \"target network\", that can be understood as an ad-hoc trust region to avoid violent gradient steps. Finally, it greedily optimizes a policy network: one of the main trick of the paper is to compute the gradient direction of the policy network, which uses the jacobian of the value network. But in the following implementation, this is automatically computed by"
